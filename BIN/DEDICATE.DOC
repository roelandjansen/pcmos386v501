Dedication
----------

The file format of the files created by these programs, which file format 
is original with the first release of this software, is hereby dedicated to 
the public domain.  Further, the filename extension of ".ZIP", first used in 
connection with data compression software on the first release of this 
software, is also hereby dedicated to the public domain, with the fervent 
and sincere hope that it will not be attempted to be appropriated by anyone 
else for their exclusive use, but rather that it will be used to refer to 
data compression and librarying software in general, of a class or type 
which creates files having a format generally compatible with this 
software.
