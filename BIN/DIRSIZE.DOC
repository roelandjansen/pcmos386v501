                                  Introduction                                



Introduction
------------

  Thank you for taking the time to download DIRSIZE.   DIRSIZE is a program
that allows you to quickly and easily determine the total size (in both
files and bytes) of any directory.    Please note that by "directory"
DIRSIZE means the "named directory" plus all "child directories" under that
directory.   In other words, if you do a DIRSIZE of your C:\ root directory,
you'll actually see how many files/bytes are occupied on your entire C: hard
drive.


How it works
------------

  Invoking DIRSIZE is simple.  First, you should copy DIRSIZE to one of the
directories listed in your PATH variable (most people have a directory named
UTILS or PROGRAMS, etc).   Then you will be able to execute DIRSIZE no matter
where you currently are on your hard drive.

  To invoke DIRSIZE, simply type:

                DIRSIZE [directory_name]

  If you don't specify a directory name, DIRSIZE will operate on the current
default directory.   You can also specify directory names on other drives,
or "logical" directories (such as "..").   A few examples:

         DIRSIZE                  -  the current directory
         DIRSIZE E:\windows       -  the E:\WINDOWS\ directory
         DIRSIZE ..               -  the current directory's parent directory

  You can also specify a FILEMASK with DIRSIZE if you wish.  I doubt that
this option will be used very often, but you can use it to only get the file
sizes of specific files in a directory.  Some examples:

         DIRSIZE *.c              -  all .C files in this directory
         DIRSIZE E:\WINDOWS\*.BAT -  all .BAT files in the Windows directory

                             Command Line Switches                            



     Switch:  -P
    Meaning:  page break
Description:  The '-p' switch tells DIRSIZE to stop the screen display and
              wait for a keypress after every 24 display lines.  Note that
              this switch is ignored if you are redirecting the output of
              DIRSIZE to something other than the screen.


     Switch:  -T
    Meaning:  only show the totals
Description:  The '-t' switch tells DIRSIZE to only display the totals and
              not each individual directory.   Only the "top level"
              directory name will be shown, but all "child" directories
              WILL be scanned as normal.


     Switch:  -?
    Meaning:  help!
Description:  The '-?' causes DIRSIZE to display a short help screen and
              then abort the program.

My Software Catalog

    Listed below is a chart of my other shareware and freeware utilities,
along with the current version number of each.  Also listed is the
filename that you will find them under on BBS systems (please note that
they may be different on your favorite BBS's, but it should help you at
least get close to locating them).   When you register one of my Shareware
programs, you will receive a disk with ALL of these utilities on it.

                             It's now been renamed to "Supersonic Search
                             Tool" to avoid confusion with other programs.
