
xxii	System Requirements: Fixing Keyboard Problems with  FIXSHIFT.COM
	----------------------------------------------------------------
	On some COMPAQ(R) machines with keyboards that have separate arrow
	keys (not part of the numeric keypad), and on some machines with
	compatible keyboards, a bug in the ROM BIOS may cause problems with
	the QuickC editor. A program named FIXSHIFT.COM is provided on
	distribution disk 4 to fix this bug. Simply copy this program to the
	directory where you have loaded the QuickC program files, type

	    fixshift

	and press ENTER. If your machine's BIOS does not have the bug, FIXSHIFT
	displays a message to tell you so.  If your machine's BIOS has the bug,
	FIXSHIFT displays prompts that guide you through the appropriate
	actions.

	FIXSHIFT requires approximately 450 bytes of memory.  Except for fixing
	the BIOS bug, FIXSHIFT has no effect on other programs that you run. It
	can be placed in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
