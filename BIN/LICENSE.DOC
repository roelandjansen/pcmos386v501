Commercial and Governmental Use

with your file(s).) This license is non-exclusive and non-

the software on a SHAREWARE basis, providing that the entire 
PKZIP/PKUNZIP/PKSFX package with accompanying documentation files is 
included in the distribution, and no more than a nominal fee (not to 
exceed $10) is charged for such distribution.
