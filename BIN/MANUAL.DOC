                                 PKWARE FEATURES

          The following features are available with PKWARE Version 1.0
          (PKZIP/PKUNZIP/PKSFX) Compression Programs.


          1.  Improved Compression!  PKZIP 1.0 implements a new compression
              algorithm called Imploding, which averages 5% to 15% better
              compression than the maximal compression (Reducing) of
              PKZIP 0.92.  Imploding is also faster at compressing and
              extracting than Reducing was.

          2.  Password encryption.  Sensitive data files can be scrambled
              with password protection.

          3.  Automatic detection and utilization of 80386 CPU's.  PKZIP
              and PKUNZIP test for the presence of an 80386 CPU.  If
              present, PKZIP and PKUNZIP will use the 80386's 32 bit
              instructions and extended addressing modes for improved
              performance.

          4.  Special file handling capabilities will automatically
              recurse through subdirectories and store pathnames within
              a ZIP file.  These paths can then be created on extraction
              if they do not already exist.

          5.  Extra compression options allow you to specify the method
              of compression (Shrinking or Imploding) to be employed.


     PKWARE                           -2-



          6.  A file that has been created as a self-extracting file can
              be treated as a normal ZIP file.  All PKZIP and PKUNZIP
              options (except -v  View) will be valid.

          7.  Files contained in a ZIP file can be viewed in several
              different ways.  For example, the can be sorted by:
              compression ratio, size, date, name, or extension.

          8.  A new option, -x, can be used to specify files to be excluded
              from any ZIP operation being performed.

          9.  Special file attributes (hidden, read-only, system) can be
              masked during creation or extraction of a ZIP file.  PKZIP
              can also be configured to include or not include hidden and
              system files.

          10. ANSI comments may be enabled/disabled.

          11. Expanded Configuration file options are available.

          12. Individual file comments (up to 60 characters in length)
              can be programmed for each file in the ZIP file.

                                    FILE COMPRESSION


               The term "compression" means to reduce in size.   Computer
          file compression refers to reducing files in size so that they
          take up less storage space on disk.  PKZIP will perform this
          reducing process quickly and easily.  The compressed files are
          then stored in a special file called a ZIP file.

          ZIP files have three distinct benefits:

               1.  They use less disk space than normal files.  Storing
                   files in compressed form increases the life and
                   storage availability of your expensive hard disk.

               2.  Many individual files can be compressed into a single
                   ZIP file.  This makes file group identification,
                   copying, and transporting faster and easier.

               3.  Compressed files travel faster via modem which
                   reduces telecommunication transmission and reception.
                   Many BBS (computer bulletin board services) use
                   PKWARE files as their standard.  This enables the BBS
                   to store more files and you to have transfer files
                   faster and easier.



                   TWO RELATED PKWARE PROGRAMS - PKZIP & PKUNZIP

               Together, PKZIP and PKUNZIP handle all of your file
          compression needs.

               PKZIP is the program that compresses files.  This shrinking
          process is often referred to as data compression.  Terms you will
          see during the compressing process are Storing, Shrinking, and
          Imploding.  PKZIP also handles all file maintenance including
          adding and deleting files, as well as reporting on technical
          information from within the compressed file.

               PKUNZIP is the program that uncompresses or extracts
          compressed files.  In addition to extracting a complete ZIP file,
          it can selectively release individual files, show files on the
          screen for fast viewing, or print them out on a printer.

                            FILE COMPRESSION TERMS

               The following terms are used throughout this manual.

               FILE = The SINGLE name that identifies information on
                    your floppy disk or hard drive.

               ZIP FILE = The file that holds file information that has
                    been reduced in size for better storage.  It is
                    sometimes called a compressed file or a library
                    file.   A ZIP file can be made up of either one or
                    more files compressed and stored together under one
                    file name.

               FILE EXTRACTION  = The process of recreating files that
                    have been previously compressed.

               FILE COMPRESSION  = is the process of reducing a file's
                    size.  This is sometimes referred to as data
                    compressing.

                  USING PKWARE WITH HARD AND FLOPPY DISK SYSTEMS

          PKWARE works BEST on a hard disk system.

           1.  Even though you are making files smaller, the process
               used to shrink them can BRIEFLY DOUBLE the storage space
               needed.  When a ZIP file is being modified (e.g. files
               being added), the process creates a new ZIP file which
               will be used as a REPLACEMENT for the old version.  Both
               the OLD and the NEW versions will be on your disk until
               just prior to the completion of the process.




     PKWARE                           -7-



           2.  When you extract a ZIP file, the amount of space
               needed to hold that file can double.  A large hard disk
               drive normally insures that enough storage area is
               available.

               Many compressed files are stored on floppy disks.  The
               limit to floppy storage is the number of characters your
               floppy system will hold:

                    Standard double density floppy     360K
                    High density floppy                1.2 meg
                    3-1/2" floppy                      .7 or 1.4 meg

               You may have problems either ADDING files to a ZIP file
               stored on a floppy disk, or extracting files to a
               floppy disk system when the number of characters in the
               ZIP file is more than 50% of the available storage space
               on the floppy disk.


          Consider a standard floppy disk system:

     PKWARE                           -8-




          There are a number of ways to avoid the limitations.  A thorough
          knowledge of PKWARE Programs will show you how to:

               1.  Selectively extract files from a ZIP file.
                   Instead of extracting everything at once, you can
                   view file size information and then select SPECIFIC
                   files to be extracted to a floppy.

               2.  If you have two floppy drives, create the ZIP file on
                   your second disk drive so that you have the full 360K
                   available to you.

               3.  Use the special  -b  command option, which routes the
                   NEW file to an alternate disk drive during the
                   compressing process then copies it back to the floppy
                   disk upon completion.



                        GENERAL RULES AND DEFAULT SETTINGS

           1.  PKWARE programs MUST be located in:

               A.  The drive you are working on, OR . . .

               B.  Any directory accessible through the PATH= setting.

                   C:> PATH=C:/Utils

               In this example, PKWARE is in the Utils Directory.  The
               computer will find and execute the program even though
               you are in a different directory or drive because any
               commands entered will be run through the PATH.  Consult
               your MS-DOS documentation for more information.

               C.  Any directory through the use of PATH notation if you
                   are using MS-DOS 3.0 or later.

                   C:>B:PKZIP  -a  OldFile.ZIP  *.*   PKZIP is located
                                                      on the B:> drive

                   C:>\UTILS\PKZIP  -v  Stuff.ZIP     PKZIP is located
                                                      in \UTILS as
                                                      indicated in the
                                                      PATH notation

           2.  All PKWARE program commands are typed at the prompt.








     PKWARE                           -9-



           3.  Typed information can generally be in upper case, lower
               case, or a mixture, except where noted in the manual.
               The following options are case sensitive:  -J -j, -W -w,
               -C -c, -P -p, and the password for the -s option.  It is
               recommended however, to use lower case when possible in
               order to be compatible with future versions of PKWARE.

           4.  The DEFAULT is  *.*  or ALL FILES when specific files are
               not named (except for the  -d  delete files option).

           5.  It is NOT necessary to type the extension  .ZIP  when
               processing a ZIP file, it will be assumed.  The extension
               is used in this documentation for clarity.

           6.  A help screen is displayed when you type the program name
               (PKZIP or PKUNZIP) at the prompt then press <enter>.
               Also typing  -h  on the command line will call up the
               help screen.

           7.  The notation  PKUNZIP *  or  *.ZIP  will extract all
               ZIP files within the given area.

           8.  During the extracting process, the notation *.* will
               tell PKUNZIP to attempt to extract ALL files whether
               they are ZIP files or not.  This could waste time, but
               will not damage any files.

           9.  The default area for the temporary second ZIP file that
               is created while the original is being updated, is the
               same path and directory location as the original ZIP
               file.  As this can cause a space shortage on a floppy
               disk, the -b option is recommended.  (See Section 3.)

          10.  The compressing function will STOP if specific, pre-
               specified files are not found.

          11.  All MS-DOS file handling procedures can be used:

                   Filename.ext          Full file name designations

                      Name*.ext          Names with wild card markers
                          *.ext
                   Filename.*
                          *.*
                   File?ame.ext

                 A:filename.ext          Disk drive and file name

                 C:\Lotus\March\*.*      Disk drive and PATH locations

                     USE OF PKWARE IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS - BBS


               Compressed library files store much information into a
          relatively small space.  PKWARE file compression methods are the
          standard used by many successful BBS systems across the country.

               Compressed files, known as ZIP files in PKWARE notation,
          created through PKWARE, assure you of the highest level of file
          accuracy.  PKWARE compressed files are the most compact, meaning
          they take less telecommunications time to deliver, PLUS PKWARE is
          FAST!  According to benchmarks published in major computer
          magazines, you will be able to manipulate your compressed files
          many times faster with PKWARE as compared to similar programs on
          the market.  PKWARE provides you with the highest standards of
          the industry.

          | Use PKZIP to reduce or compress the size of your files.    |
          | All compressed files are stored in a ZIP file, while in    |
          | their compressed state.                                    |

          | This will create a ZIP file named BUDGET.ZIP on the B      |
          | drive.  It will contain two files, both currently located  |
          | located in the C:\LOTUS directory.                         |
          |                                                            |

                           DESCRIPTION OF COMMAND OPTIONS


              The commands used in creating a ZIP file will be explained in
          detail in this section.  You will find that the new command
          format is much more flexible and easier to use.  Listed below is
          a summary of important facts to keep in mind while using PKZIP.

          - The command options can generally be placed anywhere on the
            command line.

          - The first filename listed on the command line will be
            interpreted as the ZIP file.

          - The commands can usually be typed using either upper case or
            lower case, with the following exceptions:
               W w include special files
               J j mask special files
               C c create comments
               P p store pathnames

            In general, you should use lower case for all commands that
            are not case sensitive in order to be compatible with future
            versions of PKZIP.

          - All command options for the software must be preceded by a
            '-' character or the MS-DOS switch character (usually '/').

          - Most options except where noted can be combined (i.e.
            "-x -y" or "-xy").

          - The default values for the command line are as follows:

               - If no options are entered, the default is '-a', the add
                 file option.
               - If no extension is specified for the ZIP file the .ZIP
                 extension will be used.
               - If no location is listed for the ZIP file, it will be
                 located in the current directory.
               - If no file specs (filenames, with or without wildcards)
                 are listed, the default is *.* (unless the  -d option
                 is being used).

          OPTION         SUMMARY

          -a             Adds files to ZIP file.

          -b[path]       Creates a temporary ZIP file at the specified
                         alternate location.  This temporary file is
                         used only in the creation of the ZIP file, and
                         will be automatically deleted when the process
                         is complete.

          -c -C          Adds file comments to individual files within
                         the ZIP file.

          -d             Deletes the specified files from the ZIP file.

          -e[x,s,a,b]    Specifies compression method.

          -f             Freshens files in the ZIP file.

          -h             Calls up a help screen.

          -i             Adds to the ZIP file only those files that were
                         changed since the ZIP file was last updated.

          -j -J<h,r,s>   Specifies masking or unmasking of file
                         attributes.

          -k             Retains the original date of the ZIP file
                         that is being updated.

          -l             Displays the license screen.

          -m[u,f]        Adds files to the ZIP file and automatically
                         deletes the original or source files.

          -o             Sets time and date of the ZIP file to the time
                         and date of the latest file contained in the
                         ZIP file.

          -p -P          Stores paths that are recursed along with the
                         filenames in the ZIP file.  The -p option should
                         be used with -r option.

          -q             Enables ANSI comments.



     PKWARE                           -20-



          -r             Recurses subdirectories from the specified
                         directories.

          -s<password>   Scrambles files in the ZIP file with password
                         protection.

          -u             Updates the ZIP file.

          -v[b,r,t,c,d,e,n,o,p,s] Views technical information about
                         files in the ZIP file.

          -w -W<h,s>     Specifies whether hidden or system files will
                         be included in the ZIP file.

          -x             Is used to exclude files from a ZIP file
                         operation.

          -z             Creates a ZIP comment for a ZIP file.


          Note:  Parameters listed in [ ] are optional.  Where parameters
          are listed in < >, at least one of the listed parameters must be
          specified.

              There are several size factors you must be aware of when
          using the PKZIP command.  A ZIP file can hold any number of files
          subject to the storage size of your disk.  You need unused
          storage space at least equal to the size of the existing ZIP file
          in order to complete any updating process.

              For example, if the ZIP file to be updated is currently 250K,
          you need 250K for actual storage space and another 250K for the
          updating process.  This is because PKZIP does not delete the
          original ZIP file until the new updated ZIP file has been
          created.  So at the instant the new updated ZIP file is completed
          the original ZIP file will still exist.  Therefore, you would
          need disk storage space twice the actual size of the ZIP file.

              If this poses a problem to you, it can be counteracted by
          using the -b command.  This process is explained in greater
          detail later in this section.

              This section will give a detailed explanation of the options
          used in the PKZIP command.  Recall that except where noted,
          several options can be combined on the command line, and the
          options can be placed in any order.

              The command options are explained in groups determined by
          function.  The options pertaining to adding or updating ZIP files
          are explained first, followed by the delete option, view options,
          configuration options, and miscellaneous options.





     PKWARE                           -21-



          -a  Add files to a ZIP file
          ---------------------------

              This command will add files to either a NEWLY CREATED or
          EXISTING ZIP file.  Same-name files will overwrite those already
          in the ZIP file regardless of which has the latest date.  This is
          the default option if no other options are specified.

               A:>PKZIP  -a  Text  chap1.doc chap2.doc toc.doc

              Once the program is finished creating a new ZIP file
          containing the three files listed above, the extension
          .ZIP will be added to "Text" making it TEXT.ZIP


          -u  Update existing ZIP file
          ----------------------------

              The existing ZIP file will be updated with files only if they
          are not currently in the ZIP file, or if they are dated later
          than those with the same name already in the ZIP file.

              Although this command is similar to the  -a  Add command, it
          has an update SAFEGUARD.  It will overwrite existing compressed
          files ONLY if the selected files have a more recent time and
          date.

               C:>PKZIP  -u  Oldfile.ZIP   *.Txt  Money.Wks  A:Funds.Wks

              This example will update the ZIP file named Oldfile.ZIP.  The
          files listed above will be updated within the ZIP file.  That is
          they will be added if they do not already exist, or overwritten
          if they already exist in the ZIP file with an earlier date.


          -f  Freshen files in ZIP file
          -----------------------------

              This option updates files that already exist in the ZIP file
          with same-named files with later times and dates.

              The Freshen option is limited to working with files that
          ALREADY exist in the ZIP file.  Existing zipped files will be
          overwritten ONLY if the files have been updated since being added
          to the ZIP file.  It will NOT add new files.

               C:>PKZIP  -f  STORE.ZIP  *.*

              In the above example, all the existing files in the ZIP file,
          STORE, will be updated if a newer version of the file exists in
          the current directory.





     PKWARE                           -22-



          -i  Selectively BACKUP files
          ----------------------------

              This option will add only those files to the ZIP file that
          were NOT backed up the last time.  It adds only those files that
          have been changed.  If the program returns the notation "No files
          found", this means that everything had been previously backed up.

               C:\PKWARE> PKZIP -i  allfiles.zip

              In this example, all the files in the ZIP file 'allfiles'
          that had not been previously backed up, will be backed up.


          -m[u,f]  Move files into a ZIP file
          -----------------------------------

              This option will add files to a new OR existing ZIP file then
          automatically DELETE the original or source file.  There are two
          additional options available with the Move option:  Move Update
          and Move Freshen.

              When used alone, the Move option is similar to the  -a  Add
          command option except that it automatically deletes the original
          files.  This is a real time saver, for example, when compressing
          an entire directory.  The  -m  option compresses all your files
          into a single ZIP file, then deletes the original files.

          -mu = This specifies the Move option used along with the
                Update option.  When these two options are used
                together, the existing ZIP file will be updated
                with files only if they are not currently in the ZIP
                file, or if they are dated later than those with the
                same name already in the ZIP file.  After the ZIP file
                is updated, the original files will be deleted.

          -mf = This specifies the Move option used along with the
                Freshen option.  When these two options are used
                together, files already existing in the ZIP file will be
                updated with same-named files with later times and
                dates.  After the ZIP file is updated, the original
                files will be deleted.

              The original files are deleted after the program verifies the
          ZIP file for accuracy.  If an error does occur, such as DISK
          FULL, the original files will NOT be deleted.

               C:\DB> PKZIP  -m tiny.ZIP  *.dbf

              In this example, all the database files will be compressed
          into tiny.ZIP and then will be erased from the \DB directory.

          -d  Delete files from WITHIN a ZIP file
          ---------------------------------------

              This option is used to delete single or multiple files within
          a ZIP file.  Any of the MS-DOS file handling descriptions may be
          used.  The name of the file will be displayed on the screen as it
          is being deleted.

               C:>PKZIP -d  OldFile.ZIP   Garbage.Txt  Useless.Dbf

              In this example, Garbage.Txt and Useless.Dbf will be deleted
          from the files in OldFile.ZIP


          -v[b,r,t][c,d,e,n,o,p,s]  View technical information
          ----------------------------------------------------

              This option will display technical information concerning the
          files contained within a ZIP file.  There are several options
          available with the View option.  All are explained below.  The
          options determine how the information will be displayed and
          sorted.

               The following information about each file contained in the
          ZIP file will be displayed on the screen.

                      Length      Original length of the file
                      Method      Type of file compression used

                      Name        Name of the file


               The View options for PKZIP are explained below.  The options
          determine how the information will be displayed and sorted on the
          screen.  The following display options are available:

          -vb = The  -b Brief display option will display all the
                information shown above except the CRC-32 value and the
                file attribute.

          -vt = The  -t Additional Technical display option is used to
                display extra technical information.  When this option
                is active, the following information (shown on the
                following page) will be displayed on the screen.  With this
                display, the following information about each file in the
                ZIP file will be displayed on the screen.



     PKWARE                           -24-



                The following information will be displayed for each file
          in the ZIP file, when the  -vt option is used.


                Filename            Name of the file

                                    extract the files


          -vc = This option is used to display any existing file
                comments.

          -vr = Display information in reverse order from the default
                order.  This option can be used with any of the other
                View options to reverse the order of sorting.


              Any of the display options explained above can be used with
          the sorting options listed below.

              The following sorting options are available with the View
          option.  The default order of sorting is also specified.  (This
          order can be reversed by using the particular sorting option
          along with the  -vr  View Reverse option.)

               -vd = Sort by date of files, oldest to most recent.
               -ve = Sort by file extension, alphabetically.
               -vn = Sort by name of files, alphabetically.
               -vo = Display in original order, i.e. the order in which
                     the files were zipped.  (This option can be used to
                     override any configuration parameter you may have
                     set.)
               -vp = Sort by percentage ratio of compression, smallest
                     to largest.
               -vs = Sort by size of files, smallest to largest.



     PKWARE                           -25-



              If no sorting option is specified, the files will be
          displayed in the order they were compressed.

              The following example illustrates the command used to display
          the technical information about a ZIP file sorted by date.  The
          output is shown below.

              Any of the View options listed above can be set in the
          Configuration file.  For example, if you wanted to always display
          the files contained in a ZIP file sorted by extension, this can
          be set in the Configuration file.  If no View options are
          specified, the default View setting is the order in which the
          files were compressed in the ZIP file.  Any view options
          specified on the command line will however, override the
          configuration parameters.



     PKWARE                           -26-



              The following View options can be set in the Configuration
          file.  The corresponding command line option is also listed for
          reference.

               VIEW = date      -vd
               VIEW = extension -ve
               VIEW = name      -vn
               VIEW = ratio     -vp
               VIEW = size      -vs
               VIEW = natural   -vo
               VIEW = reverse   -vr
               VIEW = brief     -vb
               VIEW = long      -vt
               VIEW = comments  -vc

              As in the view options specified on the command line, the
          last four options, reverse, brief, long and comments, can be
          combined with any of the sorting options listed above.

          For more detailed information on the Configuration file, see
          section 5.


          -c -C   Create file comments
          ----------------------------

              This option is case sensitive.  It is used to create file
          comments for the individual files contained in the ZIP file.  The
          maximum length for the comments is 60 characters.  You will be
          prompted to enter the comments.  If a comment already exists, you
          can edit it or press the <Enter> key to retain the same comment.
          To delete an existing comment, press the Space bar followed by
          the <Enter> key.

               The  -c (lower case c) option is used to edit all comments
          for existing files or files that are added.

              The  -C (upper case C) option is used when you want to create
          comments for only the new files that were added to the ZIP file.
          It is used along with the add/update options.  If -C is used
          without any other options, it has the same effect as -c.

          C:\PK> PKZIP textfile.zip -C -u

              In the above example, any comments on existing files will be
          retained and you will be prompted to enter comments only for the
          newly added files.









     PKWARE                           -27-



          -z  Create a Zipcomment
          -----------------------

              This option allows you to create a descriptive label for your
          ZIP files.  The Zipcomment will then automatically be displayed
          by PKZIP or PKUNZIP whenever the specific ZIP file is processed.

              When you type in the command, as shown below, you will be
          prompted to enter the Zipcomment.  The  -z option can also be
          used to edit an existing Zipcomment.

              The  -z  option can be used alone on an EXISTING ZIP file or
          in combination with any of the add/update commands.  Examples are
          shown below.

          C:\PK>PKZIP  zipdoc -z

              After entering the above command, the program will prompt you
          to type in a Zipcomment for the ZIP file 'ZIPDOC.ZIP'.  After
          entering the Zipcomment, press the <Enter> key to save it.


          C:\PKWARE> PKZIP zipdoc -z -a  *.doc

               In this example both files and Zipcomments will be added.
          To add files and add a Zipcomment, both the  -z and one of the
          add/update commands must be entered.


          -x  Exclude files from the ZIP file operation
          ---------------------------------------------

              This option is used to exclude files from the current
          operation.  It can be used along with any of the MS-DOS file
          handling descriptions.  It can be used along with most of the ZIP
          command options such as add, update, view, delete, etc.

          C:\pkzip stuff *.* -x*.BAK

              In the above example, all of the files in the current
          directory will be compressed into the file stuff.zip except the
          files with a .BAK  extension.














     PKWARE                           -28-



          -b[path]  Create temporary ZIP file on alternate drive/path
          -----------------------------------------------------------

              This option is designed to be used when insufficient disk
          space is a problem.  Every time a ZIP file is updated, PKZIP
          creates a new pre-ZIP file.  When the updating is completed, the
          original ZIP file is automatically deleted and the pre-ZIP file
          becomes the new ZIP file.  The result of this operation is that
          you need disk storage space equal to at least twice the actual
          size of the ZIP file while updating the ZIP file.

              Disk space is generally not a problem on a hard disk, but can
          pose restrictions on a floppy disk.  If adequate disk space is
          not available, the program will stop.

              The -b option will locate the pre-ZIP file on the path and
          location specified.  This file is used only in the process of
          updating the original ZIP file.  It will replace the original ZIP
          file and will NOT exist on the location specified in the -b
          option, when the update process is completed.  The -b option can
          be used along with any of the update options.

          C:>PKZIP a:zipdoc *.doc -bc: -u

              The above example illustrates the use of the -b option.  A
          ZIP file, zipdoc, located on drive A will be updated with all the
          .doc files.

              A temporary ZIP file, used in the update process will be
          located on the C drive.  This file will not exist when the update
          process is completed.


          -e[x,s,a,b]  Use extra compression options
          ------------------------------------------

              This option is used to specify the compression algorithm to
          be used in creating the ZIP file.  There are two types of
          compression that can be used:  Shrinking and Imploding.  The
          options are explained below.

          -ex = This specifies the Imploding method is to be used on all
                files being compressed.  In general, it provides a
                greater degree of compression over the Shrinking method.
                Note that -ex does not try both Shrinking and Imploding.
                In most cases where Shrinking would work better than
                Reducing in PKZIP 0.9x, Imploding will do better than
                Shrinking.  This is the default for PKZIP.

          -es = This specifies the Shrinking method is to be used on all
                files being compressed.  In general, it provides a
                faster method of compression over the Imploding method.




     PKWARE                           -29-



          -ea = This specifies the Imploding method is to be used on all
                ASCII files and the Shrinking method is to be used on
                all binary files.

          -eb = This specifies the Imploding method is to be used on all
                binary files and the Shrinking method is to be used on
                all ASCII files.

          Note:  You should be aware of the following when specifying a
                 compression method.

          - Using -ea -eb is the same as using -ex.

          - Numbers after the parameters such as "-ex4" or "-ea3" are
            accepted for compatibility with PKZIP 0.92 but they have no
            effect on the data compression in PKZIP 1.0.

          - Regardless of the compression method specified, files
            smaller than 320 bytes in size will be Shrunk, if enough
            memory is present.

          - Shrinking requires more memory than Imploding.  If there is
            enough memory to perform Imploding, but not enough memory to
            perform Shrinking and any of the last three options listed
            are chosen, PKZIP will issue a warning and use Imploding
            instead.  Shrinking requires about 128K to run, and
            Imploding approximately 90K.


          Some example commands are shown below.

          C:>PKZIP zipdoc -es *.DOC

              This command would Shrink all the files with a .DOC extension
          into the ZIP file.

          C:>PKZIP -ea zipdoc

              This command would Implode the ASCII files and Shrink the
          binary files.

          -p -P  Store relative paths with filenames in the ZIP file
          ----------------------------------------------------------

              This option is case sensitive.  It allows you to store the
          directory and path information pertaining to each file within the
          ZIP file (or list file).

              If -p (lower case p) is used, all the pathnames that are
          recursed into will be stored in the ZIP file.  The  -p option is
          meaningful only when used with the  -r  option explained below.
          If -P (upper case P) is used, all the pathnames specified on the
          command line and those recursed into will be stored in the ZIP
          file.


          -r  Recurse through subdirectories
          ----------------------------------

              This command allows you more flexibility when creating or
          updating ZIP files.  The program will recurse through specified
          directories when obtaining files to compress.

          For example:

          C:> PKZIP alldoc -r  D:*.doc  C:\word\pk\*.txt

              This command will search all .DOC files on the D drive and
          all  .TXT files on the C:\word\pk directory and all directories
          below.  For example:

          C:\data>PKZIP -rp stuff

              This example will compress all the files in the current
          directory, and all directories below the current subdirectory.
          PKUNZIP  can then restore this directory tree either in the same
          directory, or at any place in the directory tree.  An entire
          directory tree can be compressed into a ZIP file and then
          restored by using the  -d option in PKUNZIP.  (See the -d
          option for PKUNZIP, Section 4.)

              By default, the filename only will be stored, unless the  -p
          or  -P  option is specified on the command line.


          -l  Display the License screen
          ------------------------------

              This command will display the software license agreement.

          A:>PKZIP -l






     PKWARE                           -31-



          -h  Display help screen
          -----------------------

              This command will display a help screen whenever typed on
          the command line.

          D:\PKWARE> PKZIP -h



          -s<password>  Scramble files with password
          ------------------------------------------

              This option is used to scramble, or encrypt the files in the
          ZIP file.  It includes password protection.  When extracting the
          ZIP file, the files will not be extracted unless the correct
          password is included on the command line.

              When specifying the password, there is no space between the
          s and the password.  Also the password is case sensitive.  It
          must be entered exactly the same when you Unzip the file.  It is
          important that you remember or somehow record the passwords that
          you use, because PKZIP does not retain a record of these
          passwords anywhere.

          C:\FINANCE> PKZIP PAYROLL -m -sSecret  *.pyr

              In the above example, the ZIP file PAYROLL will be created
          with all the files having a *.pyr extension.  In order to Unzip
          this file, the password 'Secret' will have to be specified
          exactly as shown above.


          -q   Enable ANSI Comments
          -q-  Disable ANSI Comments
          --------------------------

              This option can be used to override a command in the
          Configuration file.  By default, ANSI sequences are disabled.
          ANSI sequences are enabled or disabled in the Configuration file
          by the following commands.

               ANSI = Enabled
               ANSI = Disabled

              To override the configuration string, simply include the  -q
          or  -q- option on the command line.  An example is shown below.

          C:\MAIN> PKZIP allfile.zip -u -q-

              In this example, the ZIP file, allfile.zip will be updated.
          If the ANSI comments had been enabled in the configuration file,
          they would be disabled by the  -q- option on the command line.



     PKWARE                           -32-



          -o   Set ZIP file date to latest file date included
          -o-  Set ZIP file date to current date
          --------------------------------------

              This option can be used to override a command in the
          Configuration file.  By default the ZIP file being created will
          be given the current time and date.  By using the following
          command in the Configuration file, the ZIP file date will be
          determined by the date of the latest file included in the ZIP
          file.

               ZIPDATE = latest

              To override the configuration string, simply include the  -o
          or  -o- option on the command line.  Note:  This option is
          denoted by the letter o, not a zero.  An example is shown below.

          C:\MAIN> PKZIP DONE.ZIP -a -o-  *.doc

              In this example, all the files with a .doc extension will be
          added to the ZIP file.  The file will then be given the current
          date.  Assuming the ZIPDATE had been set to latest in the
          configuration file, it would be overwritten to current by the
          -o-  option on the command line.

          NOTE:  Please see the -k option for related information.


          -k   Keep current date on the ZIP file
          -k-  Set ZIP file date to current date
          --------------------------------------

              This option can be used to override a command in the
          Configuration file.  By default the ZIP file being created will
          be given the current time and date.  By using the following
          command in the Configuration file, the current ZIP file date will
          be retained when the file is updated.

               ZIPDATE = keep

              To override the configuration string, simply include the  -k
          or  -k- option on the command line.  An example is shown below.

          C:\MAIN> PKZIP DONE.ZIP -f -k-  *.txt

              In this example, all the files with a .txt extension will be
          freshened in the ZIP file.  The file will then be given the
          current date.  Assuming the ZIPDATE had been set to keep in the
          configuration file, it would be overwritten to current by the
          -k- option on the command line.

          NOTE:  Please see the -o option for related information.




     PKWARE                           -33-



          -w<H,S>  Include hidden or system files
          -W<H,S>  Do not include hidden or system files
          ----------------------------------------------

              This option is used to specify whether or not the hidden or
          system files will be included in the ZIP file.  It can be used to
          override a command in the Configuration file.  By default, hidden
          or system files will not be included.  By using one of the
          following commands in the Configuration file, you can specify
          whether system or hidden files will be included by default.

               INCLUDE = hidden
               INCLUDE = system

              To override the string in the Configuration file, simply
          include the -w<H,S> or -W<H,S> option on the command line.  To
          specify hidden files, use H; and to specify system files, use S.
          An example is shown below.

          C:\DOS> PKZIP ALL.ZIP  -a -Whs

              In this example, all of the files in the current directory
          will be compressed into ALL.ZIP except the hidden and system
          files.  Assuming the hidden files had been included in the
          Configuration file, this command overrides the Configuration
          file.

          NOTE:  There is no space between the W or w, and the h or s.

               For more detailed information on the Configuration file, see
          section 5.



          -j<H,S,R>  Mask hidden, system or readonly file attributes
          -J<H,S,R>  Do not mask hidden, system or readonly file
                     attributes
          ------------------------------------------------------

              This option is used to mask the hidden, system or readonly
          attributes of files so that they can be treated as normal
          writable files.  This command can be used to override commands in
          the Configuration file.  By default, these files will not be
          masked.

              By using the following commands in the Configuration file,
          you can specify whether system, hidden or readonly files will be
          masked, and thus treated as normal writable files.

               MASK = hidden
               MASK = system
               MASK = readonly




     PKWARE                           -34-



              To override the string in the Configuration file, simply
          include the -j<H,S,R> or -J<H,S,R> option on the command line.
          To specify hidden files, use H; to specify system files, use S;
          and to specify readonly files, use R.  An example is shown below.

          C:\DOS> PKZIP SAVE.ZIP  -a -jrh -whs ibmbio.com ibmdos.com

              In this example, the hidden/system/readonly files IBMBIO.COM
          and IBMDOS.COM will be included in SAVE.ZIP.  However, their
          hidden and readonly attributes will be masked off in the .ZIP
          file, saving them with the system attribute only.

              When the hidden, system and readonly attribute of files are
          masked off, the  -v View option will display the attribute as --w
          (for writable) in the attribute column.

          NOTE:  There is no space between the J or j, and the h, s or r.

                       DESCRIPTION OF COMMAND OPTIONS


              The command options used in extracting a ZIP file will be
          explained in detail in this section.  You will find that the new
          command format is much more flexible and easier to use.  Listed
          below is a summary of important facts to keep in mind while using
          PKUNZIP.

          - The command options can generally be placed anywhere on the
            command line.

          - The first filename listed on the command line will be
            interpreted as the ZIP file to be extracted.  Subsequent
            filenames will be interpreted as specific files to be
            extracted.

          - The command can be typed using either upper case, lower
            case, or any combination.

          - All command options must be preceded by a '-' character
            (i.e. -v) or the MS-DOS switch character, usually '/'.

          - Unlike PKZIP, unrelated options of PKUNZIP cannot be combined.

          - The default values for the command line are as follows:

          - If no options are entered, the default is -x, the extract
            files option.

          - If no extension is specified for the ZIP file the .ZIP
            extension is assumed.

          - If no destination is specified for the extracted files, they
            will be located in directory that the program is being run
            from.

          - If no file specs (filenames, with or without wildcards) are
            listed, the default is *.*.


              The following table lists all the options valid with the
          PKZIP command.  A brief summary is also given in the table.  The
          options are explained in detail, along with programming examples,
          following the table.

          Note:  Parameters listed in [ ] are optional.  For parameters
          listed in < >, at least one of the listed parameters must be
          specified.

              This section will give a detailed explanation of the command
          options used in the PKUNZIP command.

              The command options are explained in groups determined by
          function.  The options pertaining to extracting ZIP files are
          explained first, followed by the view options, print options, and
          miscellaneous options.

          -x  Extract files from a ZIP file
          ---------------------------------

              This command will extract files from a ZIP file.  Either the
          entire ZIP file can be extracted or certain files can be
          specified to be extracted.  The extracted files will be located
          in the current directory unless you specify a destination.  The
          -x option is the default option for the PKUNZIP command.  If no
          option is listed on the command  -x will be assumed.

              If a file being extracted already exists at the same
          destination where the extracted files are being located, the
          program will prompt you for confirmation before it overwrites the
          existing file.

          C:\DB>PKUNZIP -x  A:lists.zip  *.dbf  *.txt

              In the above example, all of the files with a .dbf or a .txt
          extension will be extracted from the ZIP file called 'lists'.
          The ZIP file is located on the A drive.  When the noted files are
          extracted, they will be located in the C:\DB directory.


          -o  Extract files from ZIP file and overwrite existing files
              on disk
          ------------------------------------------------------------

              This command will extract files from a ZIP file and
          automatically overwrite any same-named files found in the
          destination where the extracted files are being located.  The
          program will NOT prompt you for confirmation before overwriting
          these files.

              Either the entire ZIP file can be extracted or certain files
          can be specified to be extracted.  The extracted files will be
          located in the current directory unless you specify a
          destination.

          C:>PKUNZIP  Zfile  *.doc -o


              In the above example, all of the files with a .doc extension
          will be extracted from the ZIP file called 'Zfile' (the .ZIP
          extension is assumed).  As the files are being extracted any
          files with the same name in the current directory will be
          automatically overwritten.

          -c[m]  Extract files from a ZIP file and display them on the
                 screen
          ------------------------------------------------------------

              This command will extract files from a ZIP file and display
          them on the monitor.  The extracted files will scroll
          continuously on the screen.  The software can be told to pause
          after each screen of output by using the -cm (more) option.

          A:>PKUNZIP  STUFF  -c  dates.doc

              In this example, the file 'dates.doc' will be extracted from
          the noted ZIP file, and displayed on the screen.



          -n  Extract only new files from the ZIP file
          --------------------------------------------

              This command will extract files from the ZIP file only if
          they are newer than the same-named ones already on the disk, or
          if they do not already exist on the disk.  This option serves as
          an overwriting safeguard.  It will not allow an older version of
          a file in a ZIP file to overwrite a newer version on disk.
          "Newer" is defined as the most recent time and date created.

          C:>PKUNZIP -n  C:\DB\lists  *.dbf

              In this example, all of the files with a .dbf extension, that
          are dated more recently than any same-named files on disk, or
          that do not already exist on disk will be extracted from the ZIP
          file 'lists'.



          -t  Test the ZIP file
          ---------------------

              This option is used to test the files to make sure they are
          valid and have not been corrupted.  The files will be listed as
          they are being tested 'OK' will listed after each file if it is
          not corrupted.  This option does not extract files from the ZIP
          file; it only tests them.  For instructions on reconstructing a
          ZIP file that has been corrupted, see the section on PKZIPFIX in
          section 5.

          C:\WORD\PK> pkunzip  zipdoc  *.doc -t

              In the above example all the .DOC files will be tested from
          the ZIP file 'zipdoc'.

          -v[b,r][c,d,e,n,p,s]  View technical information
          ----------------------------------------------------

              This option will display technical information concerning the
          files contained within a ZIP file.  There are several options
          available with the View option.  The view options for PKUNZIP are
          the same as those for PKZIP except for -vc.  In PKUNZIP -vc will
          cause the files to be sorted by the 32 bit CRC value.  Also,
          there is no  -vt (view more technical information) option.

               The following information about each file in the ZIP file
          will be displayed (scrolled) on the screen.

                      Length      Original length of the file

                                  and *=encrypted file)
                      Name        Name of the file


              The View options for PKUNZIP are explained below.  The
          options determine how the information will be displayed and
          sorted.

          The following display options are available:

          -vb = The  -b Brief display option will display all the
                information shown above except the CRC-32 value and the
                file attribute.

          -vr = Display information in reverse order from the default
                order.  This option is used with any of the sorting
                options listed below to reverse the order of sorting.

              The following sorting options are available with the View
          option.  The default order of sorting is also specified.  (This
          order can be reversed by using the particular sorting option
          along with the  -vr  View Reverse option.)

               -vd = Sort by date of files, oldest to most recent.
               -ve = Sort by file extension, alphabetically.
               -vn = Sort by name of files, alphabetically.
               -vp = Sort by percentage ratio of compression, smallest
                     to largest.
               -vs = Sort by size of files, smallest to largest.
               -vc = Sort by 32 bit CRC value.

              If no sorting option is specified, the files will be
          displayed in the order they were compressed.


              The following command illustrates the View option used to
          display a ZIP file sorted by name.  The output display is shown

          -p[a/b][c][n]  Extract files to a printer
          -----------------------------------------

              This option is used to extract files from a ZIP file and send
          them to a printer for printing.  The command parameters are
          defined below.  The parameters of the print option must be
          programmed together on the command line.  (i.e. -pac1 is correct,
          -p -a -c1 is NOT correct.)

           -p   Specifies the extract to printer option.

          a/b   The a and b parameters will set the printer device to
                either ASCII or Binary mode respectively.  If no mode
                is specified, whatever the default mode is for the
                device will be used.

                ASCII mode is commonly used to print text.  It will
                form feed after each file.

                Binary mode corresponds to the COPY command commonly
                used to send fonts or graphics to a laser printer.  It
                will not form feed after each file.

                The a and b options cannot be mixed in the same
                command.

            c   This option specifies the port that the data should be
                sent through.   If c is included in the print option,
                this specifies a serial (COM) port is to be used.  If c
                is NOT included in the print option, this indicates a
                parallel (LPT) port is to be used.

            n   This is the number of the print port being used.  It can
                be any number from 1 to 4.  If no number is listed, 1 is
                assumed by default.

          C:>PKUNZIP -pbc2  PICTURE.ZIP

              In the above example, the files compressed in the ZIP file
          'PICTURE' will be extracted and printed in binary mode to the
          serial port COM2.

          C:>PKUNZIP  stuff *.doc -p

              In the above example, all the .DOC files will be extracted
          from STUFF.ZIP to the parallel port LPT1.










     PKWARE                           -46-



          -d  Recreate directory paths upon extraction
          --------------------------------------------

              This command option uses the pathnames that have been stored
          in the ZIP file.  The directory pathnames are stored in the ZIP
          file by the use of  -p, -P and -r options in the list of PKZIP
          commands explained in Section 3.  If the stored output paths do
          not exist at the extraction destination, this command will create
          them as they are stored in the ZIP file.

          For example:  If the following directory tree exists on drive C.

               root----+-abc--+-dir1
                       |      |
                       |      +-dir2-+-dir3
                       |             |
                       +-xyz--       +-dir4
                       |
                       +-pdq


          If you then executed: PKZIP -r -p  A:STUFF  C:\abc\*.*

          If you then executed: PKUNZIP  -d  A:STUFF  C:\pdq\newabc

          After the PKUNZIP command is processed, the C drive would then
          look like this:

               root----+-abc--+-dir1
                       |      |
                       |      +-dir2-+-dir3
                       |             |
                       +-xyz--       +-dir4
                       |
                       +-pdq--+-newabc-+-dir1
                                       |
                                       +-dir2-+-dir3
                                              |
                                              +-dir4


              All of the files originally in C:\ABC and its subdirectories
          (dir1, dir2, dir3, and dir4) have been restored to C:\PDQ\NEWABC,
          with the directory tree being recreated.

              If this -d option is not specified and pathnames have been
          stored in the ZIP file, only the filenames stored in the ZIP file
          will be used, any pathnames will be ignored.

          -h  Display help screen
          -----------------------

              This command will display a help screen whenever typed on the
          command line.  The help screen will also occur when a command has
          been entered incorrectly.

          D:\PKWARE> PKZIP -h



          -l  Display the License screen
          ------------------------------

              This command will display the software license agreement.



          -q   Enable ANSI Comments
          --------------------------

              By default, ANSI sequences are filtered from the comments.
          This option allows any ANSI sequences to be displayed
          unfiltered.


          C:\ACCT> PKUNZIP ACCT.ZIP -o -q

              In this example, the ZIP file will be uncompressed
          (overwriting files existing on disk) and the ANSI comments of the
          file being extracted will be enabled.



          -j<H,S,R>  Mask hidden, system or readonly file attributes
          -J<H,S,R>  Do not mask hidden, system or readonly file
                     attributes
          ----------------------------------------------------------

              This option is used to mask the hidden, system or readonly
          attributes of files so that they will be treated as normal
          writable files.  By default hidden, system, and readonly
          attributes are masked off upon extraction.  To preserve these
          attributes, the -J option must be used.


          C:\DOS> PKUNZIP ALL.ZIP -Jhs

              In this example, any hidden or system file attributes of the
          files being extracted will be preserved.


          NOTE:  There is no space between the J or j, and the h, s or r.

          -s<password>  Unscramble files with password
          --------------------------------------------

              This option is used to unscramble, or decrypt the files in
          the ZIP file.  It is used in combination with the  -s Scramble
          option of the Zip options.  It includes password protection.

              When Unzipping a ZIP file that has been encrypted, the files
          will not be extracted unless the correct password is included on
          the command line.  Unzip skips encrypted files if the password is
          not stated on the command line.

              When specifying the password, there is no space between the
          s and the password.  Also the password is case sensitive.  It
          must be entered exactly the same as when you zipped the file.  It
          is important that you remember or somehow record the passwords
          that you use, because PKZIP does not retain a record of these
          passwords anywhere.

          C:\FINANCE> PKUNZIP PAYROLL -o -sSecret  *.pyr

              In the above example, all of the files with a *.pyr extension
          will be extracted from the ZIP file 'PAYROLL'.  In this case the
          password specified when the file was zipped, was 'Secret'.

                          CREATING A SELF-EXTRACTING ZIP FILE


               ZIP files can be extracted without PKUNZIP through the
          use of self-extraction methods.  This is useful when you need to
          transfer compressed files to a person who may not be familiar
          with file compression and extraction procedures, or who does
          not have the PKUNZIP program.  The self-extracting ZIP file is
          an executable file with a .EXE extension.  By simply typing in
          the name of the self-extracting ZIP file, the PKUNZIP extraction
          process will be performed.

               Several options are available for running (extracting) self-
          extracting ZIP files.  They are listed on the following page.

               All self-extracting ZIP files can be treated as a normal ZIP
          file.  All of the PKZIP and PKUNZIP options can be performed on
          a self-extracting ZIP file.  The only difference is, the .EXE
          extension must be specified on the command line or the program
          will search for a ZIP file with the same name.

               In the example shown below, files in the self-extracting ZIP
          file, STARTUP.EXE will be freshened using the PKZIP  -f option.

          C:\PKWARE> PKZIP STARTUP.EXE -f


               There are also several options that are available to use
          WHILE extracting the self-extracting ZIP file.  These are listed
          in the PKSFX reference guide in the next section.  An example is
          shown below.

          C:\PKWARE> SEZIP  -d C:\

               In this example, the self-extracting ZIP file, will be
          extracted with the  -d  options.  The directories stored in the
          ZIP file will be reconstructed on the C: drive.


               The ZIP2EXE program is used to create a self-extracting ZIP
          file from a ZIP file, while leaving the original ZIP file
          intact.  ZIP2EXE in turn, uses PKSFX.PRG to create the self-
          extracting ZIP file.  PKSFX must be in the current directory or
          PATH when creating a self-extracting file.  The program MAKESFX
          will create PKSFX.PRG from the distribution file.  (You must run
          MAKESFX initially before you can create any self-extracting
          files.)








     PKWARE                           -51-



               The following example illustrates the process of creating a
          self-extracting ZIP file.  If you have not run MAKESFX to create
          PKSFX.PRG, you must do this first.

     PKWARE                           -54-



                              HOW A ZIP FILE IS MADE


              PKZIP creates a temporary pre-ZIP file that has an extension
          of .!!! such as in  OldFile.!!!  during the compressing process.
          OldFile.!!! is the upgraded version of OldFile.ZIP.

              When all of your files have been successfully compressed, the
          original ZIP file is deleted and the file with the extension .!!!
          is simply renamed with a new extension .ZIP.

              It is FASTER to rename the temporary ZIP file than to copy it
          from one disk drive to another.  The FASTEST way to create your
          ZIP files is to do so from your largest disk drive.  The -b
          option is used to locate the pre-ZIP file on an alternate drive
          location, when your disk space is limited.



                            USE OF A RAM DISK WITH PKZIP


              PKZIP swaps information on and off disk memory as it runs.
          This process is NOT the same as the physical creation of the NEW
          ZIP file.  The default drive for this program activity is the
          drive from which the program was executed.  You can speed up
          performance as well as gain disk space by telling PKZIP which
          drive and/or subdirectory to use through a DOS environmental
          string.  All routing can be directed to your RAM Disk by using
          the  Set PKTMP command.

               C:>Set PKTMP=D:   --->  where "D:" refers to the RAM disk



                       LAN - LOCAL AREA NETWORK SUPPORT

              Both PKZIP and PKUNZIP, when opening files for read-only type
          access, will automatically open files in SHARE "deny write
          access" mode.  This pertains to systems running with DOS 3.0 or
          above, so that files can be read concurrently by other tasks.
          PKZIP uses a unique filename for all temporary files created.
          This allows PKZIP to be run by concurrent programs or on a
          network drive without any file contention or conflict.

                         CREATING A PRE-SELECTED LIST FILE


              This option is used to create List Files to record file
          selections you use frequently.  These List Files can then be
          typed on the command line instead of typing all the file names
          separately. List Files can be used with all the PKZIP and PKUNZIP
          command options.

              The procedure for creating List Files is somewhat easier with
          the new PKWARE programs.  The following example illustrates the
          steps necessary for creating List Files.

               |________________________________________________|


              When using a List File, it is preceded by the @ symbol on the
          command line.  If the List File is not in the directory, the @
          symbol is put before the PATH designation.   Note:  more than one
          list may be used on one command line.

               The List File can be mixed with other options, examples are
          shown below.

               C:>PKUNZIP  -r  NewFile.ZIP   @Group

               C:>PKUNZIP  AnyFile.ZIP   Today.Txt  @Group  @Data

                         USE OF PKWARE IN BATCH FILE PROCESSING


              When running PKZIP and PKUNZIP with other applications, you
          can test if the PKWARE experienced an error by using the DOS
          error level variable.  PKZIP and PKUNZIP return zero error level
          if no errors have occurred.

              If an error has occurred, the software will return one of the
          following error codes:


           PKZIP:
                    0    No error.
                    1    Bad file name or file specification.
                    2,3  Error in ZIP file.
                    4-11 Insufficient Memory.
                    12   No files were found to add to the ZIP file,
                         or no files were specified for deletion.
                    13   File not found.  The specified ZIP file
                         or list file was not found.
                    14   Disk full.
                    15   ZIP file is read-only and can not be modified.
                    16   Bad or illegal parameters specified.
                    17   Too many files.

          PKUNZIP:
                    0    No error.
                    1    Warning error (such as failed CRC check).
                    2,3  Error in ZIP file.
                    4-8  Insufficient Memory.
                    9    File not found.  No ZIP files found.
                    10   Bad or illegal parameters specified.
                    11   No files found to extract/view etc.
                    50   Disk Full.
                    51   Unexpected EOF in ZIP file.

          NOTE:

             Please note that if testing errorlevels in a batch file that
          DOS tests the errorlevel not for equality, but for greater than
          or equal to.

             For example, if the software exits with an exit code of 10,
          errorlevel 10 will be true, and so will errorlevel 9, errorlevel
          8, and so on.  Therefore, Errorlevel 0 will always test as true.
          Therefore, errorlevels should be tested in descending order.

               if errorlevel 50 goto err50
               if errorlevel 10 goto err10
               if errorlevel 9 goto err9
               if errorlevel 4 goto err4
               if errorlevel 2 goto err2
               if errorlevel 1 goto err1
               echo No Error
               goto exit
               :err51
               echo Unexpected EOF
               goto exit
               :err50
               echo Disk Full
               goto exit

                             THE CONFIGURATION FILE


               The Configuration file can be used to set parameters to
          values other than the normal default values.  These values will
          then be the defaults for the specified parameters.  You can
          override any parameters that are set in the Configuration file
          by entering contrary instructions on the command line.

               PKZIP 1.0 will look in the current directory for the
          Configuration file called PKZIP.CFG.  If not found, then PKZIP
          will look for an environment variable of the form

               This is a brief explanation of the configuration options for
          PKZIP 1.0 and their equivalent command line options.  An asterisk
          (*) indicates that this is the default for PKZIP.

          Note:  Some of these options can be combined.  The last three
                 options, reverse, brief and long, can be combined with any
                 of the above options.

     PKWARE                           -59-



               For some of the parameters, only one value can be specified.
          For example, ANSI can be either enabled or disabled.  In other
          cases, more than one variable can be set per parameter.  For
          example, INCLUDE can be set to either system and/or hidden
          files.

               The parameters can be typed in uppercase, lowercase, or a
          combination.  When more than one variable can be set per
          parameter, the variables can be listed on the same line,
          separated by a comma (,), switch (/), or space.

               For example, when setting the MASK parameter to include all
          readonly, hidden and system files to be masked any of the
          following programming methods would be acceptable.



               MASK=readonly
               MASK=hidden
               MASK=system

               MASK=readonly, hidden, system

               MASK=readonly hidden system

               MASK=readonly/hidden/system

               MASK=readonly, hidden/system


               There are two environmental variables that can be set.
          These environmental strings can be typed in on the command line
          at the DOS prompt.

          Setting the path for the Configuration file.

               C:>SET PKZIP.CFG = C:\UTILS

               In this case, PKZIP.CFG is located in the \UTILS directory.
          Use the location of your choice.


          Setting a RAM disk.

               C:>SET PKTMP=D:

               This will speed up the program operation default by
          directing the mechanics of PKZIP to a RAM disk.  This has
          nothing to do with the creation of the "new" archive file during
          the add or upgrade process.

                                 ERROR MESSAGES


               The following error messages may appear when using PKZIP.
          When the word 'WARNING' appears in the message, program
          execution will continue, otherwise, the program will abort to
          DOS.

          A brief explanation of each message follows.


          PKZIP:  Can't open XXXX.ZIP for write access!

               The named ZIP file is read-only or locked by another
               application and can not be modified.


          PKZIP:  No file(s) found.

               No matching files were found to list using the View
               option.


          PKZIP:  Insufficient disk space for updated files:  XXXX.ZIP.

               The -b option was used, and there is not enough space on
               the original drive containing the ZIP file to receive the
               updated ZIP file.  Try to free up some space on the drive
               containing the ZIP file, and retry the operation.  Also,
               make sure that the drive specified with the -b option is
               different than the drive containing the ZIP file.


          PKZIP:  Insufficient disk space for ZIP comment.

               There is insufficient disk space to hold the comment as
               entered.


          PKZIP:  Warning!  Not enough memory for Shrinking method.

               The -es or -ea or -eb options were used to specify that
               certain files should be Shrunk.  However, there is not
               enough memory available to perform Shrinking.  Instead,
               all files will be Imploded.


          PKZIP:  Warning!  Can't delete XXXXX.

               The -m (Move) option was specified to delete files after
               the ZIP file was constructed.  However, the named file
               could not be deleted, and is probably read-only.




     PKWARE                           -61-



          PKZIP:  No files specified for deletion!

               The -d (Delete) option was specified, but no filenames
               were given to delete.  This option does NOT default to
               *.* if no filenames are given.


          PKZIP:  Nothing to do!

               No matching files, or files with the specified
               attributes, or files after the specified date etc., were
               found to compress.


          PKZIP:  Insufficient memory.

               Insufficient memory is available to process the ZIP file.
               Try making more memory available to PKZIP.  If this does
               not rectify the problem, then the ZIP file might be
               corrupted, and PKZIPFIX should be used to fix the ZIP
               file.


          PKZIP:  XXXX.ZIP - error in ZIP, use PKZIPFIX.

               The named ZIP file has a corrupted file index.  Use
               PKZIPFIX to reconstruct the ZIP file.


          PKZIP:  Can't create: XXXX.

               The named file could not be created.  Either the target
               directory is full or the file already exists and is read-
               only or locked by another application.


          PKZIP:  Disk full, file:  XXXX.

               A disk full error occurred while writing to the specified
               file.  Try freeing up some disk space on the target
               drive.  Also, see the -b option and the PKTMP environment
               variable.


          PKZIP:  Can't find:  XXXX.ZIP.

               The named ZIP file could not be found.


          PKZIP:  Too many files.

               There are too many files to compress into one ZIP file.  The
               limit is 3900 files per ZIP file.



     PKWARE                           -62-



          The following error messages may appear when using PKUNZIP.  A
          brief explanation of each message follows.


          PKUNZIP:  Warning!  File XYZZY already exists.  Overwrite (y/n)?

               The file XYZZY already exists on the disk.  Pressing N
               will leave the original file on the disk, and not extract
               the file from the ZIP file.  Pressing Y will extract the
               file from the ZIP file, and overwrite the file on the
               disk.  Also, see the -o and -n options.


          PKUNZIP:  Warning!  I don't know how to handle:  XYZZY.

               The file XYZZY is compressed or encoded in a way that
               this version of PKUNZIP is unable to handle.  Either a
               later version of PKUNZIP is required to properly extract
               this file, or the ZIP file is possibly corrupted.


          PKUNZIP:  Warning!  Inconsistent local header for file:  XYZZY.

               The local header for file XYZZY is different than the
               central header information.  Use PKZIPFIX to reconstruct
               the ZIP file.


          PKUNZIP:  Warning!  File fails CRC check.

               The CRC-32 check for the file being extracted or tested
               did not match the stored value for the file.  The file is
               probably corrupted.


          PKUNZIP:  Warning!  XXXX.ZIP has errors.

               The named ZIP file had one or more errors detected in it.


          PKUNZIP:  Warning!  File has bad table.

               The file being tested or extracted has an error in its
               encoding.  The file is probably corrupt.


          PKUNZIP:  Warning!  No file(s) found.

               No files were found to extract, test, or list.







     PKWARE                           -63-



          PKUNZIP:  Warning!  XXX.ZIP - error in ZIP, use PKZIPFIX.

               The named ZIP file has a corrupted file index.  Use
               PKZIPFIX to reconstruct the ZIP file.


          PKUNZIP:  Warning!  Insufficient memory.

               Insufficient memory is available to process the ZIP file.
               Try making more memory available to PKUNZIP.  If this
               does not rectify the problem, then the ZIP file might be
               corrupted, and PKZIPFIX should be used to fix the ZIP
               file.


          PKUNZIP:  Warning!  Can't create: XXXXX.

               The named file could not be created.  The output
               directory is either invalid or full.


          PKUNZIP:  Can't find: XXXX.ZIP.

               The named ZIP file(s) could not be found.


          PKUNZIP:  Can't open: XXXX

               The specified file list could not be opened.


          PKUNZIP:  Warning!  Can't open XXXX.ZIP

               The named file could not be opened.  Either a disk error
               occurred, or the file is locked by another application.


          PKUNZIP:  Disk full, file:  XXXXX.

               There is not enough free room on the destination
               drive/directory for the file being extracted.  The
               program will abort and exit to DOS.


          PKUNZIP:  Incorrect password for file.

               The ZIP file is password protected, and cannot be opened
               unless the correct password is entered.  The password
               entered is not the correct password.







     PKWARE                           -64-



          PKUNZIP:  Skipping encrypted file.

               Only the files that are password will be skipped (not
               extracted) because they are password protected and the
               correct password was not entered.



                          PKZIPFIX - RECONSTRUCTING ZIP FILES


               PKZIPFIX is a simple to use utility that takes advantage of
          the extra reliability of the ZIP file format to reconstruct
          truncated or damaged ZIP files.  The ZIP file format was
          designed for high reliability, using  4-byte signatures for all
          file headers, and redundant distributed and centralized
          directory structures.

               PKZIPFIX, however, cannot create good data out of bad data!
          If a portion of a ZIP file has been corrupted, PKZIPFIX will
          allow recovery of the unaffected files.  Depending on how badly
          damaged the ZIP file is, one or more files may still extract
          with errors.

               PKZIPFIX should be used when PKZIP or PKUNZIP indicates
          that a ZIP file is in error, or a ZIP file has become damaged.
          PKZIPFIX can also be used to extract the ZIP file portion from a
          PKSFX self-extracting file.

               The file that is created by PKZIPFIX, PKFIXED.ZIP, can then
          be extracted or listed with PKUNZIP.  IT is strongly recommended
          that you then use PKZIP to create a new ZIP file from the files
          that are extracted from PKFIXED.ZIP.
