# This is the home of PC-MOS/386; based off the last released commercial version (v5.01), development now continues under a GPLv3 license in the hope that it will be both an educational and useful project.

This tree:

* includes sources
* includes the executables
* includes the cdrom driver from Rod Roark (sources)
* maybe more

* does atm NOT include the borland compiler/tools -- not sure if releasing them here is OK.
  (will have to find out -- else I will document it all for you)

In concert with Gary Robertson and Rod Roark it has been decided to place all under GPL v3.
This does only apply to the PC-MOS/386/The Software Link inc/CDROM code. Does not apply for helper files that 
are included and publically available.

The C compiler and linker et al can be downloaded from several places. Giving the age of the compiler tools
I think it's not a problem to add it. And if it's a problem (1998....) I will remove the files. 

The PC-MOS386 v5.01 API itself has been documented in Ralf Brown's interrupt list.
